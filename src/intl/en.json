  "aboutOurStory": "Lease on the Block emerged from a shared frustration with the promises of Web3.  Users who can benefit the greatest from inclusive financial systems, asset tokenization, and regulatory process automation have been left out of the conversation.  If software is eating the world, technologists in all disciplines have an obligation to prioritize high impact solutions to the most important problems facing the communities in which they live.  From this perspective, LOTB community took upon itself with our relevant industry experience in software engineering, product management, blockchain engineering, regulatory compliance, and project management to make a maximum impact in affordable housing.",

  "aboutOurVision": "The Internet grew to what it is today thanks to the open source community and the idea that knowledge must be spread and shared.  We choose to make Lease On The Block open source because we want the technology we build to be accessible to everyone.  By 2050 the UN estimates that 68% of the world will live in a Metropolis.  We choose to start LOTB with NYC and run our pilot fall 2020 in the Neighborhoods of Inwoods and Washington Heights.  As a World city NYC is the perfect laboratory test and market fit LOTB. Our success in NYC will give us the key to deploy all around the world.  We want to become the standard technology to support tenants organizations all across the world."
